# Deployment

## Release Notes
Version 1.0.1 - The current system supports the functionality of the splash page and use cases one and two. This enables users to find the closest five chargers using use case one and to filter chargers based on various attributes using use case two. Use case three is currently under development. The functionality of this application depends on the Bristol Open Data API and MapBox API. If either of these services is unavailable, the application will not operate as intended. The Deployment Diagram depicted below illustrates the interaction of this web application with Bristol Open Data and MapBox.
