# Design

Our design philosophy is anchored in meeting the diverse needs of our users, focusing on three core use cases: effortlessly locating the nearest charger, seamlessly filtering chargers based on specific preferences, and providing intuitive directions for optimal navigation.

In the first scenario, we've crafted a sleek, minimalistic interface that streamlines the process of finding the nearest charger. Through a clear and intuitive layout, users can swiftly pinpoint their current location alongside nearby charger locations on an interactive map. Complementing this visual aid, a concise list of charger details appears on the left-hand side, meticulously sorted by proximity, ensuring users can identify the closest options at a glance.

For the second scenario, our design empowers users with the ability to refine their charger search with precision. A easy to navigate filtering menu provides options to customise search criteria such as power output and socket type. This tailored approach ensures users are presented only with chargers that align perfectly with their vehicle specifications and personal preferences, enhancing the efficiency and relevance of their search experience.

By seamlessly integrating these features, including map visualisation, intuitive sorting, and customisable filtering, our design not only simplifies the process of finding a charger but also elevates user satisfaction by delivering a tailored and seamless experience.
