# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Our project aims to create a web application designed to empower users in Bristol with electric vehicles. This innovative app will enable users to seamlessly pinpoint the nearest electric car charging stations while offering the flexibility to choose a charger based on their specific requirements, including power output, tariff, and charging speed.

### Business benefits
The envisioned web app is set to revolutionise the electric car charging experience for Bristol's eco-conscious community. By providing a swift and efficient means to discover compatible charging points, it will not only streamline the electric vehicle charging process but also contribute to reducing the carbon footprint in the region.

### Options Considered
While existing solutions, like the Tesla Supercharger Network, serve a select audience, our project's inclusive approach caters to all electric vehicle users in Bristol, irrespective of the car's make and model.

### Expected Risks
* Market Competition: There are already established electric car charger finder apps and services. New entrants may struggle to compete with existing platforms.
* Security and Privacy: Handling user data and location information comes with security and privacy risks.
* User Experience and Design: User-friendliness and a visually appealing design are critical. If the app is not intuitive and easy to use, users may abandon it in favor of competitors.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
* Geolocation
* User Registration
* Filter options based on charger type, power output, tariff, and charging speed
* Interactive maps for navigation

### Out of Scope
* Regulatory and compliance issues related to charging station
* Hardware infrastructure for charging stations
