## User Needs

### User stories
As an electric car user I want to find car chargers so I can charge my car.
As a user, I want to filter charging stations based on the type of charger (e.g., Level 2, DC Fast Charger) so that I can choose the one that is compatible with my electric car.
As a user, I want to be able to see the charging station's operating hours and pricing information, if available, so that I can plan my charging stops efficiently and budget for it.
As a user, I want the app to provide directions to the selected charging station, either through an integrated navigation system or by launching a third-party navigation app.
